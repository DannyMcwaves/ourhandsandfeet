## Helping Charities find volunteers

This is the frontend for the ourhandsandfeet website. Here are the steps to get the development version running. First, you should probably check the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_QDDbqmBrJuGqBoib59fmgYtls03dAXXuLqRR5roPO4/edit">"Getting started"</a> document to make sure you have all of the necessary prerequisites installed.

Clone this repository into a directory of your choice from the terminal using "git clone [url of this repository]

From the same directory, run "yarn install"

Run "bower install"

Run "npm start"

Now, open your browser and go to localhost:9000.

If all goes well, the webpage should be running correctly.

Note that you will not be able to use the "Login" feature of the website unless you also run the backend server.
